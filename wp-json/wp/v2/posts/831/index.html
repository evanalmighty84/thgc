Between our daily responsibilities of cooking, cleaning, laundry, home maintenance is something that we often neglect. Like your vehicle, your home and property benefit from regular tune-ups.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here are 7 Home maintenance hacks that you should follow:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Quick homeownership cost calculation:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The 1% rule is suggested for maintenance for your home every year. For a home that costs $300,000\/- budget 1% or $3,000\/- as maintenance of the house for one year. This can even go up to 4% of the property\u2019s value, according to research done by US News and Freddie Mac. For instance, 4% of a $300,000\/- home comes to $12,000\/- a year as annual maintenance cost.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Keep an eye on plumbing and drains.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>One effortless maintenance item you should keep on top of is the plumbing and drains in their homes. Roots, deposit build-up, etc., can create problems at the most inconvenient times. Search for a maintenance plan with well-established plumbing and drain company. You will thank yourself for being a regular when it comes to plumbing, as plumbing defects can lead to expensive damages.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Schedule a cleaning routine.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Dust emission is widespread in urban areas that arise due to gardening to large-scale industrial operations. Dust particles small enough may lead to irritation of the eyes, coughing, sneezing, and asthma attacks. Regular cleaning would help prevent dust accumulation at your home. Use a wet cloth for dusting while rugs should be washed regularly.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Check your home detectors.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors have to be examined seasonally to be sure that you and your family member are warned in case of an accident. Examine your sensors at the beginning of each season and change the batteries when needed.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Maintain heating and cooling systems:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Almost every home has climate control systems like heating and air-conditioning, which regulate the air in the house. Due to this, vents and filters in these systems get clogged - polluting the air inside. Thus, you must thoroughly clean ducts and filters to maintain a healthy home. Regular maintenance of climate control systems improves their performance for long life.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Inspect fire extinguishers\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Make sure your fire extinguisher is in a visible location, and everyone can have easy access. Check the locking pin is intact, the pressure gauge is operable, the directions are legible. Inspect the extinguisher to make sure there is no damage, leakage, or rusting. Lastly, please pick up the fire extinguisher to make sure it is still full.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>7. Replenish your medical kits\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Remember to check your first aid kits at the beginning of every month and restock what you used! It\u2019s also necessary to assess your emergency supplies and replace any old or expired items.<\/p>\n\n<p>Managing a home is a tedious task. Figuring out all the things you need to do to keep your home healthy and happy may seem never-ending. Maintain log or spreadsheet of all your tasks and improvements \u2014 big and small, long term and short term. Break them down according to seasonal needs to help prioritize. With appropriate organization and planning, you\u2019ll\u2019 be able to handle all your new home\u2019s needs like a pro.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Home maintenance is something we often neglect, but when your home is your biggest asset, looking after it is essential for most of us.
