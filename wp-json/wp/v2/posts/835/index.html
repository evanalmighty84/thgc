The open road is in front of you, and with all of the national parks and wild spaces available to explore in the U.S., there is nearly endless adventure ahead.<\/p>\n\n<p>But of course, you\u2019ll have to make sure you are prepared before any big trip. Having the right gear ensures safety, and will save you money and time in the long run. You don\u2019t want to have to go out on a trip and be worried about the RV and small issues that can come up.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here are a list of maintenance checklist for your RV to ensure it is always ready for your trips<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Examine the roof, seals, and seams of your RV<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Check your RV\u2019s roof every three months to ensure that there are no water leakages. This, in turn, helps to prevent extensive damage to the ceiling. Leakages occur through the RV\u2019s roof edges, vents, skylights, or air conditioning unit. Water soakage on the roof\u2019s outer wood framework can get into the inner sealing panels causing severe water damage. Use an effective sealant compatible with the material used for the RV roof to patch up the leak.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Check your RV\u2019s batteries<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Make sure your RV\u2019s battery is always fully charged. The Battery life of your RV depends on the type of battery use. A deep cycle battery loses capacity after three years, while a Start-type battery loses power after five years.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Maintenance of RV\u2019s brakes<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The safety of you and others while being on the road should be on the top of your checklist. Brake maintenance depends on wheel bearings, and so it has to be lubricated throughout the summer. Also, make sure that the brakes have enough material left on them to work correctly. Otherwise, replace it. This costs about $300 to $500 and includes repacking of wheel bearings and replacing the seals.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Change RV\u2019s oil<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>As an RV is stationary at most times, you have to change the oil on a seasonal basis. This enhances lubrication and running capacity. Make sure you change the RV\u2019s oil after it has run about 3000-4000 miles every year. This prevents excessive wear and tear on its engine, which helps to avoid expensive service or replacement. You also have to change the air, fuel, coolant, and hydraulic filters on your RV on a seasonal basis. This has to inspected while changing the oil. The engine and drive train are taken care of because of this.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Advice to young couples<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>For young couples buying their first RV depends upon their lifestyle and the time spend on it. It a learning experience on what to do and what not to do on their RV. They can opt for a lesser-priced RV initially, and later after gaining experience, they can go for a more costly one with enhancements.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Cover your RV while it in storage<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Your rig\u2019s exterior is prone to naturally caused damages such as dust, debris, rain, and ultraviolet radiation. Ensure that you keep your RV in an indoor, temperature-controlled facility and invest in a high-quality water-proof RV cover if your RV is sitting on a tarmac.<\/p>\n\n<p>Owning an RV is a matter of joy and adventure but caring for it also equally important. So, plan your repairs and maintenance accordingly.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Sitting behind the wheel of your new RV comes with a lot of elation and anticipation.
