You are excited to hit the water on your boat; worrying about the finances in case of an unfortunate event would be the last thing you would want. So, make sure your boat is well insured.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>We have collated seven significant points you should be aware of while purchasing a Boat Insurance policy:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Understanding the different Boat insurance coverage<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>It's crucial to know how much it would cost to rebuild your boat if necessary and keep your insurance agent informed on any upgrades you have made to your boat. The buyer of boat insurance must be aware of these concepts to avail the best policy suited for their vessel.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Replacement cost<\/strong>\u00a0policy means the buyer's compensation with a\u00a0likeness\u00a0to the original one in all aspects.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Market cash value<\/strong>\u00a0means repaying the insurer with the actual cost of repairs for the boat, where the compensation claimed is\u00a0the replacement cost\u00a0of the boat\u00a0less depreciation.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Agreed value<\/strong>\u00a0is the best type of boat insurance policy to ensure if a loss happens, you are eligible for\u00a0the value of your boat agreed\u00a0by you.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>You may have to update your policy to keep up with your needs.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Discounts for being a Safer boater\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>A boater who has completed an approved course on boating safety can avail discount on the boat insurance. It is one of the best ways to reduce boat insurance premiums. The safer boater is also entitled to a lay-up discount if the boat is used only certain times during the year in freshwater conditions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Navigational Limits of your Boat insurance<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The navigational limit in the policy determines the coverage. You can determine the claim on the boat insurance policy by certain factors like distance covered by the boat from the boat's dock or moor, launch site, or the water's shoreline.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>For instance, if your boat is not within the navigational limits as mentioned in the policy, you would not be eligible for a claim in case of any damage caused.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>4. The various factors that determine your Insurance premium<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The cost of the boat insurance also depends upon the size and the speed limits of the boat. Bigger size and higher speed cost more. Other factors for the insurance policy are age, value, condition of the ship like how and where the boat is used, type of motors like inboard or outboard, and whether the insurer lives on the boat.<\/p>\n\n<p>You are eligible for discounts on factors like the years of boating experience, where your boat is parked, and your boat's examination by Coast Guard Auxiliary.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Canceling the policy during Off-Seasons could be a costly affair<\/strong>\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>Many boat owners will intentionally cancel their coverage during the off-season. This puts them under many risks that could damage the boat when it's not in the water. Dropping coverage may result in the boat owner being exposed to pay for the damage. For instance, if the boat is harmed in the driveway due to unfavorable weather conditions, you will have to bear the entire cost.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>6. Did you know that the place where your boat is damaged can affect your claim?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Many varying circumstances determine the claim's nature, and you must be aware of what their policy covers. If the boat is damaged while parked at home and if Homeowner's insurance policy covers it, you can claim from Homeowner's insurance policy. Likewise, if it is damaged while towed by your vehicle, you can claim from your auto insurance company, and Boat insurance covers the damages if the boat is harmed while parked at the dock.
